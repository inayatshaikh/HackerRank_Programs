# HackerRank_Programs

This Repository will help you to find the solutions of the problems available on the coding platform HackerRank. 
I have experienced that many budding programmers and coder stuck in questions and give up very soon. So this is the place
where you will find the solutions to your questions. 
I am also in a process of learning and really interested in the competitive programming as soon as I solve a problem I will share that in this repository.

You can watch my hackerrank profile [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/soumilk_k).

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU SHOULD TRY YOUR BEST TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY YOURSELF AND THEN OPEN UP THE SOLUTION.    
This repo is open for pull requests so if anyone want to share their code just make a PR.

Try to understand the Code and the logic applied in solving the question. 
Mostly Problems are solved in C++, C ans some in python.

Happy Coding !! :D
